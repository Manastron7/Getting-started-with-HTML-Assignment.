    <hr><hr>
    <p>A galaxy is a colossal collection of stars, planetary systems, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter, bound together by gravity. These cosmic entities come in a variety of shapes and sizes, ranging from spirals with graceful arms to ellipticals, irregulars, and even dwarf galaxies.<br><br> At the heart of most galaxies lies a supermassive black hole, exerting a profound influence on their dynamics. The Milky Way, our home galaxy, contains hundreds of billions of stars, with our solar system nestled within its spiral arms. Galaxies, scattered throughout the cosmos, serve as the building blocks of the universe, housing the celestial tapestry that has fascinated astronomers and stargazers for centuries.</p>
